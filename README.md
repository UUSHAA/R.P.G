# R.P.G

As a final year project for my computer science degree, I chose to create a role-playing game (RPG) with a text-based user interface (UI) using C++. To start, I researched various RPG games, their features, storylines, and characters. I also researched C++ libraries and frameworks that could be used to create the game.

With a clear idea of what I wanted to achieve, I began the game design process, creating a storyline and characters, identifying game mechanics, and creating a layout for the game world. I also created a list of potential enemies and challenges for the player.

Next, I implemented the game code using C++. I created functions and classes to handle game logic, such as character creation, inventory management, combat, and quests. I also integrated input/output functionality to handle user interaction with the game.

During development, I frequently tested the game, identifying and fixing bugs, and making improvements. I incorporated feedback from peers and my supervisor to make the game more enjoyable and engaging for players.

Overall, creating an RPG with a text-based UI in C++ was a challenging and exciting experience. It required research, planning, and implementation skills. However, it provided an excellent opportunity to develop my programming skills and problem-solving abilities.
